//! Protocol negotiation: one `initialize` that both stacks can answer.
//!
//! The peer tells you what it speaks. Config is a cache of that answer at best
//! and a lie at worst, so crow-term asks instead of declaring: a single UNION
//! `initialize` goes out — v2's `protocolVersion: 2`, `info` and `capabilities`
//! alongside v1's `clientInfo` and `clientCapabilities` — and the version in the
//! response picks the stack. Neither schema denies unknown fields and each
//! version reads only its own keys, so the same bytes work in both directions.
//!
//! The probe IS the connection. It runs on the live [`Channel`] the winning
//! stack then adopts, which is why this is hand-rolled rather than delegated to
//! [`Client::protocol_connector`]: the connector starts the v2 implementation
//! and, on a v1 answer, drops the connection and calls the agent factory again.
//! That costs a second spawned process for every v1 agent, and it cannot work at
//! all for an attach endpoint, where the "factory" is a dup'd fd or a socket the
//! peer already accepted and the peer has already eaten one `initialize`.
//!
//! [`Client::protocol_connector`]: agent_client_protocol::Client::protocol_connector
