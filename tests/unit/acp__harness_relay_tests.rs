//! The `/harness` relay — the seam that lets one controller thread outlive the
//! connection it started with.
//!
//! `run_blocking`'s supervisor loop distinguishes a switch from a shutdown by
//! whether `switch_rx` yields, so everything load-bearing is a channel
//! behaviour of `relay_commands`: what it forwards, what it intercepts, what it
//! hands back, and what it tells the painter. Tested with channels, not with a
//! spawned agent — `tests/startup_session_e2e.rs` owns that rung.
